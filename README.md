# Automated Dog Feeder
An automated pet feeding system that allows for manual and schedule based control as well as controlling the amount of food being released.

## Motivation
The goals of this project are
* To understand how to build a scale system using arduino capable of measuring up to several pounds of food accuratley
* To build a fully remote managable system that can be controlled from external applications using an API for various control
* To allow the unit to run in isolation on a schedule and keeping clocks in sync so the schedule is as accurate as possible
* Experimenting with designs to keep the form factor as minimal as possible, the end result will be ideal for a residential setting with limited space.
